        C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis
        Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972. It is a very popular 
        , despite being old. The main reason for its popularity
        is because it is a fundamental language in the field of computer science.
        The C programming language is a general-purpose, operating
        system-agnostic, and procedural language that supports structured
        programming and provides low-level access to the system memory. 
        Dennis Ritchie invented C language in 1972 at AT&T 
        (then called Bell Laboratory), where it was implemented 
        in the UNIX system on DEC PDP II. It was also the successor
        of the B programming language invented by Ken Thompson.
        C was designed to overcome the problems encountered by
        BASIC, B, and BPCL programming languages. By 1980, 
        C became the most popular language for mainframes, microcomputers,
        and minicomputers.

        Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language
        that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.
        It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers
        write once, run anywhere (WORA),[16] meaning that compiled Java code can
        run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.
        Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any
        Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer 
        architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer
        low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides 
        dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification)
         that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages.
        Java gained popularity shortly after its release, and has been a very
        popular programming language since then.[18] Java was the third most
        popular programming language in 2022 according to GitHub.
        Although still widely popular, there has been a gradual decline
        in use of Java in recent years with other languages using JVM
        gaining popularity.

        Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language.
        Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of
        significant indentation.Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected.
        It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured 
        (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming.
        It is often as a "batteries included" language due to its 
        comprehensive standard library.Guido van Rossum began working on Python
        in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first
        released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.[35] Python 2.0 was released in 2000.
        Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision not completely
        backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2.7.18, released
        in 2020, was the last release of Python 2.

        Full stack development is the process of developing both the frontend
        and backend of applications. Any application has a frontend (user-facing)
        component and a backend (database and logic) component. The frontend
        contains the user interface and code related to user interactions with
        the application. The backend contains all the code required for the
        application to run, including integrations with data systems,
        communicating with other applications, and processing data.
        Software developers require slightly different skills, tools, and software
        knowledge for frontend and backend development. However, 
        full-stack development combines both disciplinesâ€”meaning teams
        can build applications from start to finish in an integrated 
        and cohesive manner. A full-stack application is a software application
        that encompasses both frontend and backend in a single code base.
